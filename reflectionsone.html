                          <br><br><strong>One: Play the travel game. </strong>
                          <br> <br>
                          Upon arrival at Aeropuerto BCN, I hadn’t slept in almost 36 hours and sported fanny pack and a huge hardcore backpacking bag.
<br><br>Challenge one: Buy my month-long T-Mes, 1-zone, youth discounted super special transport pass in broken Spanglish.
<br>Challenge two: Figure out how to use trains, and miss one because you don’t realize you need to press a button to open the doors (and the locals laugh at you).
<br>Challenge eleven: Act as an English—French—Spanish translator between a bunch of people to complete a shopping transaction.
<br>Challenge thirty-one: With a phone almost as dead as you, sprint like Usain Bolt to catch the hourly night bus which may or may not take you home.
<br>Challenge one hundred and one: Explain to Spanish security guards why you need your swiss army tool inside the museum.
<br><br>
Thinking of travel like a game helps me position the challenges I face as a (solo) traveller and adventures instead of obstacles. It’s all about your viewpoint of whatever life throws at you.
                          <br><br><strong>Two: Language is power. </strong>
                          <br><br>
                          Being submerged in Spanish culture and colloquial language helped me realize that languages you learn in class are a world of difference from that same language in daily life. Knowing how to speak someone’s language gives you the power to build relationships and gain perspective on culture understand and communicate with them on a level of their thoughts.
<br><br>
Though out of my comfort zone, I attempt all purchases and interactions in Spanish. Though it doesn’t always go as planned, locals really appreciate your effort to speak their language even when you forget a phrase or two. Royal Palace security guards instantly become nicer.  Service is faster at the cheese shop. They are generally excited that a turista puts forth the effort and it’s far easier to get discounts, directions, or explanations even with language fundamentals.
<br><br>
Though my day is split equally between Spanish and English, I also occasionally speak French and Ukrainian to help other tourists. The ability to communicate with a wide range of individuals has afforded me an array of fascinating stories, recommendations, and hilarious moments with other tourists. Language has given me a power of making a fascinating group of acquaintances, including (but not limited to) the night bus driver who also works as a standup comedian, the shopkeeper with indie music recommendations, and the Americans pretending to be Canadian.

                          <br><br><strong>Three: Student budget mindset works wonders.</strong>
                          <br><br>
                          My sister has a motto: if it’s free, it’s for me, and maybe for you too. Essentially, spend your money the right way and get as much free stuff as you can.
                          <br><br>
                          Student discounts have saved me over 200 euros on attractions alone. Just about every museum or park has publicized or hidden discounts for certain dates and age groups. Research before you go and take advantage of them - never buy tickets before calling or checking online first for pricing! Timing discounts are also fantastic because just about every historical & artistic attraction has a free afternoon or night admission. In Barcelona, Sundays are free museum day, parks are always open, and there’s so many low-cost or free cultural expositions. Figure out how to make your spending worthwhile by asking people and researching before hand (Sagrada Familia for 20 euros is amazing!)
                          <br><br>
                          Food is without a doubt my biggest expense thus far after train transport. Personally, I go for a balance of good local specialities (with the budget filter on) and delicious grocery store handmade meals. Treating yourself and getting a feel for the area’s specialities for cheap means spend 10 minutes on TripAdvisor and city blog sites cross referencing for a great place. For a filling and budget friendly lunch, I generally go for the supermercado shopping adventure. My current travel companions know all about how to make food coma- worthy bocadillos (large spanish sandwich) for three people with ten euros and a swiss army knife.

                          <br><br>
                          Places: Barcelona, Madrid, Tarragona, Pamplona, Montserrat & more adventures to come! Thanks for reading.
