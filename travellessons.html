From April to June, I’ll have travelled over 8,500 kilometers as a tour leader for Brightspark Canada. Spending about four days a week giving tours in Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City has allowed me to appreciate Canada’s landscapes, landmarks, and history. It also changed my outlook on travel and taught me far more than the knowledge I share with others. Be it three days or three months, here’s my tips to make the best of the voyage.
<br><br><span i><strong>Plan spontaneity.
<br>Listen to people’s stories.
<br>Get out of your comfort zone. </strong></span>
<br><br><strong>One: Travel is about planning spontaneity. </strong>
<br> <br>
I always struggle with balancing planning and spontaneity when I travel. Equally as important as hitting those four attractions in a day is allowing time to discover the vibe of the locale and its inhabitants. Planned spontaneity is how you make the best of your time in a new place because you’re prepared enough to know what’s around but also ready for chance happenings with an open mind. Before arriving, research from TripAdvisor, reddit, and friends helps me structure attractions, museums, and show times so that I can take advantage of the day. Opportunities during my tour leading day to simply walk and discover new areas of cities I thought I knew made me realize the importance of simply immersing yourself in a place by having time to explore. The best way to balance the desire to see lots but also feel the vibe of your destination is scheduling these spontaneous times. Maybe it’s giving yourself an hour to wander in a new neighbourhood, randomly asking locals for suggestions, or just jumping on a bike and pointing yourself somewhere. Plan to NOT plan and you’ll be amazed at what you can see.
<br><br><strong>Two: Travel is about hearing people’s stories. </strong>
<br><br> Discovering and adding to a collective narrative is one of the most rewarding aspects of travel. Every place’s narrative is made up of intertwined stories of locals and other travellers building their lives within the environment. Travelling lets you interact with these stories to reflect on your narrative and expand your perspectives. Many of my favourite travel memories are rooted in these interactions, ranging from satirical remarks to grand tales of adventure I experience through the eyes of another. From coach driver Frank’s journeys biking in Australia to a new friend’s story of immigration from South America to hearing students talk about differences between their suburb and Montreal, understanding other people’s stories helps me reflect on global citizenship and broaden my perspectives. Everybody has a story, regardless of job title, socioeconomic status, or lived-experience. When you’re travelling, enrich yours by hearing theirs.
<br><br><strong>Three: Travel is about getting out of your comfort zone.</strong>
<br><br>
Travel helps you realize that life is exciting. Getting out of a comfort zone means different things for everyone; I’m most fascinated by experiencing things unique to the area I’m in. I’m comfortable in the Toronto city - suburban lifestyle but immersing myself in a different place presents new social norms and therefore opportunities out of my vie quotidien. Trying crickets and local cheeses, seeing crazy contemporary art or roller derby, biking on a canal - small things that aren’t too far out of my comfort zone but still made my travel experience more local, diverse, and rewarding. On the more thrill-seeking side, maybe bungee jumping or white water rafting is more your thing. Trying something new broadens your perspectives and makes you a more creative soul, things you’ll invest back into your life at home.
<br><br>
Travelling is a combination of hustling, creativity, spontaneity, and a never-ending carpe diem attitude. Don’t forget the narrative you build along the way - take photos, journal, collect items so you can reflect on your adventure. Travel taught me the value of going on spontaneous adventures, meeting cool people, and trying new things - not only when travelling, but every single day.
